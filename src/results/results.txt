## Analysis

### Add Operation
Adding players to the roster goes fast no matter how big the roster gets.
It takes basically 0.0ms for 50 players and only 0.3ms for 5000 players.
And This makes sense because we're just adding to the end of the array, so we
don't have to move anything around. The only time it slows down a bit is
when the array runs out of space and needs to resize itself.

### Remove Operation
Removing from the front is where things got down. With 50 players it was fine,
but once it hit 500 and 5000 players, the time went up a lot. This happens because
every time the first player is removed, the rest of the list has to shift forward.
So the bigger the roster, the more time it will take.

### Search Operation
Searching gets slower as the roster size increases. This is because the search
has to go through more players when the list gets bigger, especially when the
 player isn’t found.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, adding and searching work pretty well even with large rosters. However, removing
from the front does not scale well and becomes very slow for large data sizes.
